# Art Book Ruined for Batocera & AmberELEC

A minimal theme with support for an 4:3 aspect ratio.  
Tested on [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) and [AmberELEC](https://AmberELEC.org).  Should also work with [Retrobat](https://github.com/kaylh/RetroBat), [EMUELEC](https://github.com/EmuELEC/EmuELEC) or [JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution)
